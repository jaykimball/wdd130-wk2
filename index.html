      <p>
        Hello! My name is John Momoh, and I am from Lagos, Nigeria. I am
        currently pursuing a BSc in Software Development at BYU-Idaho, where I
        focus primarily on web development, though I also have an interest in
        broader software engineering practices. One of the aspects I enjoy most about coding is the
        constant opportunity to learn. Each project offers a new challenge,
        whether it's mastering a new framework, implementing efficient
        algorithms, or ensuring that a user interface is both functional and
        visually appealing. Outside of coding, I enjoy engaging with
        communities, particularly those related to my faith. I take part in a
        student fellowship, where I contribute by building websites and managing
        technical tasks for our gatherings. It's a fulfilling experience that
        allows me to apply my skills in a meaningful way, while also fostering a
        sense of community. My long-term goal is to become a full-stack
        developer with a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end
        systems, as well as cloud computing and cybersecurity.

      <p>
        Lagos is a mega city in the country Nigeria. Lagos State, Nigeria's most
        populous region, is a vibrant hub of culture and economy. Known for its
        bustling markets and nightlife, itâ€™s often called the "City of Aquatic
        Splendor" due to its extensive coastline. With a strong focus on
        finance, technology, and entertainment, Lagos is a center for innovation
        in Africa. Home to landmarks like the National Theatre, it blends
        tradition with modernity, showcasing the dynamic spirit of its people
        despite challenges like traffic and urbanization.
